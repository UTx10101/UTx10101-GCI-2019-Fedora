# A Mathematics Game
Code files by UTx10101 to complete a GCI-2019 task published by Fedora: [Here](https://codein.withgoogle.com/dashboard/task-instances/5364857386303488/)
## Dependencies:
1. `eel` - The Main thing which helped me create this project.
2. `random` - Module to randomize questions
## Steps to Run:
(Get the dependencies installed)
1. Just run `python Game.py`
And it's done the game window will open and you can enjoy with your another friend by solving challenging problems but you still need to start from Level-1 i.e. 1+1 ;-)
## How to Add more questions
Open Game.py and on the top you can find a dict named quests just analyze what the fields mean and add your own questions.
## Here are some screenshots:
