### Note:- This Circle Visualizer uses purely pygame and no other graphics module except math module which is just for the floor function.

# Circle Visualizer - GCI-2019 - UTx10101
This is a Circle Visualizer which when given radii of two circles and distance between their centers prints whether they are
`Tangent` , `Intersecting at two points` , `Non-Intersecting` or `Cocentric`. Also it provides a graphical representation of
the states of circles.

## Dependencies:
1. `python >= 3.6`
2. `pygame` module with its own dependencies.
3. `math` module
4. The png images present with the source file.
5. And Obviously some data to test.

## Steps to Run:
1. Type - `$ python GCI-CircleState.py`
2. Enter the data
3. You get a graphical window showing the output.
