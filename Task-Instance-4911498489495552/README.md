## Dependencies:

**Note:- Get the dependencies pre-installed if you are copy-pasting code to run it in your system.
1. Clone this repo using `git clone` by doing this you won't need to installed ExpressJS as its already present with the code files here.
2. `cd UTx10101-GCI-2019-Fedora/Task-Instance-4911498489495552` into cloned directory
3. Run `npm start` you will need to install `npm` for this. Alternatively you can run `node server.js` once you have `node.js` installed.
